weâ€™ve been filming all day and today we
bought darts
my friend says one time some guy
provoked him so much that he threw
a dart into his leg
after that, the guy enrolled in a military academy.
today we filmed down a tunnel
where the rats were as fat as piglets
and the miners fed them saying
when you tame them they come in handy
they flee when they know
the devil is going to play for keeps
so the miners run too"""                                                            )
